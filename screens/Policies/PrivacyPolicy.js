                    Like most website operators, The Net Giver Foundation
                    collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                    that web browsers and servers typically make available, such
                    as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
                    and the date and time of each visitor request. The Net Giver
                    Foundation's purpose in collecting non-personally
                    identifying information is to better understand how The Net
                    Giver Foundation's visitors use its website. From time to
                    time, The Net Giver Foundation may release
                    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
                    e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                    website. The Net Giver Foundation also collects potentially
                    personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                    (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
                    comments on http://www.ngfnd.org/ blog posts. The Net Giver
                    Foundation only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
                    addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
                    discloses personally-identifying information as described
                    below.

                <Text style={text.smTxtSmBotML}>
                    Certain visitors to The Net Giver Foundation's websites
                    choose to interact with The Net Giver Foundation in ways
                    that require The Net Giver Foundation to gather
                    personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                    information that The Net Giver Foundation gathers depends on
                    the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
                    who sign up for a blog at http://www.ngfnd.org/ to provide a
                    username and email address.

                    The security of your Personal Information is important to
                    us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
                    Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
                    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
                    protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.

                    just keep you up to date with what's going on with The Net
                    Giver Foundation and our products. We primarily use our blog
                    to communicate this type of information, so we expect to
                    keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a

                    help us support other users. The Net Giver Foundation takes
                    all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
                    unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
                    potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information.
